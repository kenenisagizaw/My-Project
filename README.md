# My-Project
This program allows users to register regular and extension students, remove students, display all registered students, generate registration slips, and exit the program. The program is well-structured and uses a menu-driven approach.
# Features
- Register Students: Register regular and extension students with their details.
- Remove Students: Remove existing students based on their ID.
- Display Students: Display information about all registered students.
- Generate Registration Slips: Generate registration slips for students.
- User-Friendly Menu: Interactive menu for easy navigation.
-Input Validation: Ensure valid input for student details.
- Here are a few points to consider:

# Documentation:
It's always good practice to include comments or documentation in your code to explain the purpose of classes, methods, and important sections of the code. This helps other developers (or even yourself in the future) understand the code more easily.

# Exception Handling:
Your code includes exception handling for invalid input, which is good. However, when catching exceptions, it's often beneficial to provide more descriptive error messages or log messages to help users understand what went wrong.

# Menu Structure: 
The menu structure is clear and user-friendly. Each option corresponds to a specific action, making it intuitive for users to navigate.

# Resource Management:
You are closing the Scanner and exiting the program in case 6. It's good practice to close resources like the Scanner, but in this case, since the program is exiting, it might not be strictly necessary.

# Validation:
The input validation is well-handled in methods like validateId, validateYear, and validateSemester. This ensures that the user input meets the specified criteria.

# Code Organization:
The code is organized into methods, which is good for readability and maintainability. Each method has a specific responsibility, making the code modular.
